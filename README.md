Data base: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1O9aE_Hen5smf_a6TsbVF6DM0ms4Ykj6s?usp=share_link  - "commodities.xlsx", this file needs to be in the same folder of the one that we are writing the code

For that we will create a web automation

- we will use selenium
- Do not forget to download the webdriver
